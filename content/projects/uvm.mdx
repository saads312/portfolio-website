# UVM Testbench Architecture
![Testbench Architecture](/uvm.png)

## Overview
Developed a **UVM testbench** for a data alignment module. Utilized the UVM framework in SystemVerilog to design comprehensive test scenarios, ensuring robust and thorough verification of the module's functionality.

## Details
- Created a reusable **agent class** to facilitate easy integration and testing of various modules.
- Implemented a **model** to simulate the expected behavior of the data alignment module.
- Developed a **scoreboard** to compare the module's output against the expected results, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- Designed multiple **test scenarios** to cover a wide range of use cases and edge cases.
- Employed UVM's built-in features for **reporting and logging**, enhancing the debugging process.
- Ensured modularity and scalability of the testbench for future enhancements and adaptations.

## Tools
- SystemVerilog
- UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)
- EDA Playground for simulation and testing
