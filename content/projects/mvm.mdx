# MVM Engine

## Overview
Implemented a **matrix-vector multiplication engine** capable of producing 27 outputs in parallel at 270 MHz.

## Details
- Built modules for dot product, accumulator, dual-port memory, and control FSM  
- Optimized dot product operations with **DSP48e1 slices**  
- Deployed on a **PYNQ-Z1 FPGA**

## Tools
SystemVerilog, AMD Vivado, FPGA Programming, ML Accelerator Design
