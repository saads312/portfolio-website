# Tanh Approximation

## Overview
Designed a **hardware circuit to approximate the hyperbolic tangent function**, accurate to 7 decimal places.

## Details
- Used **ready/valid handshakes** for latency-insensitive data transfer  
- Pipelined with **18 register stages**, raising frequency from 170 MHz â†’ 320 MHz  

## Tools
SystemVerilog, AMD Vivado, FPGA Programming
