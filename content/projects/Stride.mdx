# 🏃‍♂️ Stride – Play Sports, Make Connections

Stride is a social sports app designed to bring young athletes and enthusiasts together for recreational games. Too often, people want to play but don't have enough friends available, or struggle to find local matches. Stride solves that by making it simple to discover games, join teams, and build a community around shared sports interests.

## Key Features

With Stride, users can:

- **Find nearby games** — filter by sport, time, and skill level
- **Join or create matches** — whether it's pickup basketball, soccer, or a casual volleyball game at the park
- **Connect with players** — chat, form teams, and build friendships both on and off the field
- **Stay active & social** — encouraging healthy lifestyles while making sports more accessible and fun

## The Vision

Stride is more than just an app — it's a way to make recreational sports spontaneous again. By lowering the barrier to play and making it easy to meet others, Stride empowers young people to stay active, meet new friends, and keep the love of the game alive.
